# random-qoute-generator
This project, is about fetching data with ReactJS API

The front end is built with React, to make get requests to JSON API.  

I'm just starting out with react and following through with [JavaScript Mastery] on YouTube, to
- understand basic React workflow
- how to make API requests in React Apps and
- how to fetch API data with React js.
